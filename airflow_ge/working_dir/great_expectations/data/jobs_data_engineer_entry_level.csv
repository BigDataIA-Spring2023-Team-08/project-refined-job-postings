Bobbie is creating a parenting culture of confidence, not comparison. And it starts with how we choose to feed our babies. We crafted our European style infant formula with purposefully sourced, organic ingredients to give parents a product they are proud to feed their babies, direct to their doorstep. Bobbie is proud to be the only US formula that is designed to meet both FDA and EU standards.

Although 83% of parents turn to formula in the first year of their baby's life, this is the silent majority that is often shamed for not being able to exclusively breastfeed. Co-founded by two moms and created by a team of mom scientists, nutritionists, pediatricians, and lactation consultants, the Bobbie team knows first hand that there is no one size fits all for feeding. With Bobbie, we hope you can Bottle Boldly.

Owing to outdated processes and bad actors, traditional debt collection is rife with harassment and fraud. Our products tackle this by helping financial institutions modernize collections, giving borrowers simpler and more compassionate ways to get back on track.

What's in it for you:

Software Engineers at January aren't just responsible for writing code. You'll also own product and team outcomes, advocate for customers, and help other engineers grow.

At the same time, January is deeply invested in your growth as an engineer. You'll work with your manager to craft a development plan with personalized career goals and we'll give you the support and resources to help achieve those goals.

The main ways you'll impact the business are:

Borrower Experience. You'll work to make the collections experience simpler and more empathetic for borrowers, improving recoveries. This might include running experiments to improve conversion, analyzing user behavior to find opportunities, and designing reinforcement learning models to automate decision making.
Client Experience. Build simple, best-in-class tools to help creditors engage with their borrowers, analyze effectiveness, and automate operations.
Technical Leverage. Develop simple solutions to complex technical scaling problems, improving developer leverage, reliability, security, and compliance. Depending on your areas of expertise, this may include infrastructure scaling, domain modeling, performance optimization, and continuous deployment.
Developing Peers. When you work at January, you work with a team that grows together. Regardless of your current level, you'll share your knowledge of systems, engineering practices, and the problem domain, helping ensure everyone's success. You'll do this through code review, pair programming, documentation, and just plain being supportive.


As the company grows, you will be involved in scoping, architecting, and implementing new product lines. You'll have the opportunity to build new lines of business from scratch.

You might be a fit if you value:

Genuine collaboration. We recognize and explicitly reward feedback, alignment, and learning from each other.
Managers as advocates. You'll report to leaders invested in your growth and promotion, not just their own. Managers only succeed when their teams thrive.
Outcomes over output. We value finding ways to do more with less, working smart instead of burning out.
Product ownership. Engineers are owners, not mercenaries. Everyone plays a role in discovering, advocating for, and implementing product ideas.
Technical quality. We work collaboratively with product to ensure great outcomes without sacrificing quality. Sustainable development is a first-class priority.


What you bring to the table:

Have 0-6 years of experience as a Software Engineer
Are proficient in at least one programming language such as Python, Java, or C++
Have strong problem-solving and analytical skills
Want the chance to collaborate closely with your peers
We find that candidates who perform particularly well in this role have full-stack experience
