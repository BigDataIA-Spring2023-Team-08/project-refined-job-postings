We Have 4 Distinct Products

We believe that Narrativ can create an entirely new class of audio content for people to consume that meets their current consumption preferences. In the last decade, readership has plunged in the face of listenership, and we want to be the entity that enables consumers to listen to anything that was previously limited to written form.

An integrated player that can serve audio directly on publisher websites

This may include: tidy/refactor of existing integrated players; deploying integrated player to new publishers (e.g., tweaking CSS/HTML to work within variety of platforms); adding new features/functionality (e.g., new behaviors to the player).

This role will start focused on execution in the publisher-integrated player and may evolve into ownership of this component. This role will likely also contribute to the ad/publisher platform, and depending on personal interest, the mobile app.

This employee will work closely with the CTO in order to create the best user experience possible.

Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in computer science or related technical field
Strong knowledge of UI / UX
0-2 years of working experience as a front-end software engineer

Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla. We rely on data – lots of it – to improve autopilot, to optimize hardware designs, to proactively detect faults, and to optimize load on the electrical grid. We collect data from each of our cars, Superchargers, and energy storage devices to make these products better and our customers safer.

We're the Fleet Analytics team, a central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect. We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can self-serve those analyses in the future. To do so, we leverage our internal data platform built on top of AWS, S3, Spark, Trino using open source data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Bokeh, Superset, and Airflow. Our work has a direct impact on Tesla's product, and enables the work of hundreds of engineers across disciplines throughout the company.

We're looking for a talented engineer to own the full breadth of data engineering, data analysis, and data science activities for one of our partner engineering teams. You will leverage Tesla's wealth of device data and a first-principles approach to problem solving to inform future hardware and firmware designs, as well as ensuring that our existing vehicles, chargers, and energy devices continue to perform to Tesla's exacting standards. In this embedded role you will partner with a team focusing on another discipline (e.g., mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or firmware engineering), joining their projects to help define product requirements, optimize control algorithms, or otherwise improve the product quality. You will also work with other members of Fleet Analytics for peer reviews, technical growth, and to build sophisticated tools and and infrastructure for working with device data. These tools will be used across the team to improve our efficiency and also shared with the rest of the company so that those we do not directly support still benefit from our work.

What You’ll Do
Work with stakeholders to take a vague problem statement, refine the scope of the analysis, and use the results to drive informed decisions
Write reproducible data analysis over petabytes of data using cutting-edge open source technologies
Summarize and clearly communicate data analysis assumptions and results
Build data pipelines to promote your ad-hoc data analyses into production dashboards that engineers can rely on
Design and implement metrics, applications and tools that will enable engineers by allowing them to self-serve their data insights
Work with engineers to drive usage of your applications and tools
Write clean and tested code that can be maintained and extended by other software engineers
Operate and support your production applications
Keep up to date on relevant technologies and frameworks, and propose new ones that the team could leverage
Identify trends, invent new ways of looking at data, and get creative in order to drive improvements in both existing and future products
Give talks, contribute to open source projects, and advance data science on a global scale
What You’ll Bring
Strong proficiency in Python, SQL
Strong foundation in statistics
Experience building data visualizations
Experience writing software in a professional environment
Strong verbal and written communication skills
Strong problem-solving skills to help refine problem statements and figure out how to solve them with the available data
Curious and driven to solve complex problems
Smart but humble, with a bias for action


Nice To Have
Experience with data science tools such as Pandas, Numpy, R, Matlab, Octave
Experience with complex hardware systems
Experience building data pipelines
Experience building web applications
Experience building machine learning models in a professional environment
Experience with continuous integration and continuous development
Experience in devops, i.e. Linux, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes
Understanding of distributed computing, i.e. how HDFS, Spark and Presto work
Proficient in Scala
