Every morning, 11,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. While retirement should be an exciting, empowering, and fulfilling part of one's life, the reality today is that retirement brings along with it a fundamentally new set of challenges that make it an overwhelming time for many.

At Chapter, we believe that the current infrastructure for retirement is broken, and we're on a mission to fix it. We've started by building industry leading technology to solve the first major obstacle in retirement: navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65). Our products help seniors sign up, choose an insurance plan, and leverage their plan after they are enrolled. And, unlike most Medicare advisors who only search plans that pay them, Chapter searches every Medicare option nationwide. This allows us to find savings and benefits that others miss.

But our ambition doesn't stop with Medicare — we seek to transform the way that Americans navigate and experience retirement. If this sounds exciting to you, we'd love to speak with you.

About The Role

We're looking for a Data Scientist to join the Data team at Chapter. You'll join a tight-knit team and be empowered to work closely with our product teams to help build out the future of analytics at Chapter.

How You'll Contribute To Our Mission

You'll be helping establish the foundation for data-driven decision making at Chapter, which includes problems like user segmentation, experimentation, engagement, retention and churn. This means collaborating closely with product managers and engineers to help them understand product performance across our various products, internal and external. Ultimately, you'll be part of a team that will focus on making sure that we deliver delightful customer experiences and improve the lives of the 11,000 Americans entering retirement every day.

Be a strategic partner for the business; identify areas of opportunity and work with cross functional teams to execute on them.
Work with stakeholders to define and calculate key metrics and make them available through dashboards and analyses and scale them up through automation
Build and maintain critical data sources related to product initiatives
Present learnings and insights in close collaboration with PMs to cross-functional teams
Be a close partner to product managers in impact sizing and prioritizing their roadmap


About You

5+ years of experience in analytics related field
Comfortable with SQL/python or other query compatible language. (We use pyspark; prior experience is helpful but not required)
Proficiency with quantitative analysis and visualization. Able to turn ambiguous and messy data into presentable insights.
Comfortable with ambiguity, strong attention to detail, strong communication, ownership orientation, empirically driven


We think the salary for this role will be between $160,000- $200,000, in addition to competitive variable compensation + equity structure, but it might vary depending on skills and experiences. If you think you'd be a good fit for the role, you should apply. All of our offers are based on our assessment of each individual's unique skills and experience.

Our Commitment

Chapter embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Chapter will provide any necessary accommodation during the recruitment and selection process to an employee or applicant with a disability.

Location

You can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

Every morning, 11,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. While retirement should be an exciting, empowering, and fulfilling part of one's life, the reality today is that retirement brings along with it a fundamentally new set of challenges that make it an overwhelming time for many.

At Chapter, we believe that the current infrastructure for retirement is broken, and we're on a mission to fix it. We've started by building industry leading technology to solve the first major obstacle in retirement: navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65). Our products help seniors sign up, choose an insurance plan, and leverage their plan after they are enrolled. And, unlike most Medicare advisors who only search plans that pay them, Chapter searches every Medicare option nationwide. This allows us to find savings and benefits that others miss.

But our ambition doesn't stop with Medicare — we seek to transform the way that Americans navigate and experience retirement. If this sounds exciting to you, we'd love to speak with you.

About The Role

We're looking for a Data Scientist to join the Data team at Chapter. You'll join a tight-knit team and be empowered to work closely with our product teams to help build out the future of analytics at Chapter.

How You'll Contribute To Our Mission

You'll be helping establish the foundation for data-driven decision making at Chapter, which includes problems like user segmentation, experimentation, engagement, retention and churn. This means collaborating closely with product managers and engineers to help them understand product performance across our various products, internal and external. Ultimately, you'll be part of a team that will focus on making sure that we deliver delightful customer experiences and improve the lives of the 11,000 Americans entering retirement every day.

Be a strategic partner for the business; identify areas of opportunity and work with cross functional teams to execute on them.
Work with stakeholders to define and calculate key metrics and make them available through dashboards and analyses and scale them up through automation
Build and maintain critical data sources related to product initiatives
Present learnings and insights in close collaboration with PMs to cross-functional teams
Be a close partner to product managers in impact sizing and prioritizing their roadmap


About You

5+ years of experience in analytics related field
Comfortable with SQL/python or other query compatible language. (We use pyspark; prior experience is helpful but not required)
Proficiency with quantitative analysis and visualization. Able to turn ambiguous and messy data into presentable insights.
Comfortable with ambiguity, strong attention to detail, strong communication, ownership orientation, empirically driven


We think the salary for this role will be between $160,000- $200,000, in addition to competitive variable compensation + equity structure, but it might vary depending on skills and experiences. If you think you'd be a good fit for the role, you should apply. All of our offers are based on our assessment of each individual's unique skills and experience.

Our Commitment

Chapter embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Chapter will provide any necessary accommodation during the recruitment and selection process to an employee or applicant with a disability.

If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation at any time during the recruitment process, please let us know.

Starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're rearchitecting the way it's delivered – leveraging breakthroughs in diagnostics, remote monitoring, and a variety of other domains, Homeward is creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality.

Most importantly, we're aligning everyone's incentives (ours, partner health plans', and members') towards getting and keeping people healthy by taking full responsibility and financial risk for the total cost of each member's healthcare and outcomes.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

The Opportunity

Join us in tackling healthcare for rural America! We're seeking a Data Scientist who is passionate about having a positive societal impact and using technology for good – solving issues of health inequity for communities that have been perennially underserved.

As an early hire, you'll be a strong well rounded resource in the analytics space – dig into business intelligence and reporting, deeper-dive analytics, and support predictive modeling, leveraging your proven track record for success in healthcare analytics.

What You'll Do

Identify needs and deliver analytics and data science products – from business intelligence to analytics to predictive modeling
Develop, mature, and deliver our business intelligence strategy across the enterprise, across growth, clinical delivery, quality, and cost results for internal and external audiences
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify highest-priority research questions, analyze relevant data, and generate actionable insights that enable improvement
Develop, design, and evaluate tests, spanning valid experimental or test design, identifying appropriate sample size, and conducting aligned statistical analysis
Develop systems and processes to use our data effectively, accurately, and efficiently across the enterprise
Collaborate with our Technology team to deliver requirements on the highest priority data sources and most appropriate structures for analytics
Support and enable predictive modeling across growth and clinical delivery domains


What You Bring

Why DISCO?




We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:




We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO’s long-term strategy.
We believe that product and engineering professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we’re going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don’t commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view. At DISCO respect isn’t earned, it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you’ll find yourself learning at a rate you’ve not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you’ll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best “career shape” of your life.
Over the next 4 years, we’ll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way
We use the “2 Pizza Team” organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we’re an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you’re passionate about your craft.




Perks of DISCO




Open, inclusive, and fun environment
Benefits, including medical
Competitive salary
Flexible PTO
Opportunity to be a part of a company that is revolutionizing the legal industry
Growth opportunities throughout the company




About DISCO




DISCO provides a cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal solution that simplifies ediscovery, legal document review and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers and governments. Our scalable, integrated solution enables legal departments to easily collect, process and review enterprise data that is relevant or potentially relevant to legal matters.




Are you ready to help us fulfill our mission to use technology to strengthen the rule of law? Join us!




We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.




Please note that DISCO has a mandatory COVID vaccination policy which requires all employees in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated, subject to applicable legal exemptions.

Texas Health and Human Services Commission requires the services of 1 Data Scientist (Big Data Engineer) 2, hereafter referred to as Candidate(s), who meets the general qualifications of Data Scientist (Big Data Engineer) 2, Data/Database Administration and the specifications outlined in this document for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.




Pursuant to a grant received from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Services department (USDA-FNS), HHSC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) is seeking to further develop and expand the role of Data Analytics in the identification and investigation of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The HHS Systems Agency (hereafter referred to as “the System Agency” or HHSC) is seeking the services of a Data Scientist Level 2 to provide business intelligence services with expertise in the field of Data Science/Data Analytics to review and assess the available beneficiary data and develop a sustainable data analytics model to progress the maturity and effectiveness of Data Analytics for detection and prevention of fraud, waste and abuse in the SNAP Program.




The Data Scientist Level 2, in close coordination with System Agency staff, will be responsible for building a Data Analytics Model (hereafter referred to as “the Model”) for this OIG project.

Respond to HHSC questions within two (2) business days of receiving an inquiry;
Remain available to meet with the HHSC (mainly virtually) as needed to support deliverable timeframes and project schedule objectives;
Attend and actively participate in periodic, standing meetings with HHSC to discuss progress and solution challenges or barriers;
Communicate challenges early to facilitate coordinated solutions;
Make iterations of the model available to HHSC staff in an agreed-upon, accessible format, in alignment with project timeframes, for testing and validation;
Provide the output from the model in an agreed-upon format for easy consumption;
Monitor and refine the data model to produce a sustainable SNAP beneficiary fraud detection solution that can be used by both eligibility and investigative staff to identify and prevent SNAP fraud;
Adjust the model based on feedback received, so that it produces viable and accurate results, as expected; and
Use HHSC network infrastructure and equipment when accessing and working with HHSC data and following applicable Acceptable Use Agreement and network security policies and procedures to protect the security of any data transmitted to or exchanged with the Data Scientist Level 2 throughout the term of the contract.




Project Deliverables




Review available data and develop a project implementation plan within thirty (30) days of hire. Many of the steps in the plan may be an iterative process, which the project schedule must account for. The plan must include a schedule of additional deliverables and milestones throughout the life of the contract, including but not limited to elements such as the following
Complete initial review of available data elements and architecture;
Recommend software or other infrastructure needs required to implement the model;
Suggest combinations of data that could be analyzed as potential indicators of fraud, waste, or abuse;
Develop algorithms or data analytics methodologies and applying them to the data to produce fraud, waste, and abuse indicators;

Adjust the model as needed based on testing outcomes, including incorporating new IP address software, tolerance levels and thresholds, if needed;
As appropriate, apply technology or software components that allow the analytics model to continue learning from the data over time and that allows the model to continue functioning beyond the term of the contract with minimal maintenance or intervention by HHSC;
Implement the final, validated version of the model; and
Provide a schema for HHSC personnel to maintain the model in the future, as the grant stipulates sustainability.
Deliverables must be submitted in a format approved by the HHSC Grant Project Director;
If the deliverable cannot be provided within the scheduled timeframe, the Data Scientist is required to contact the HHSC Grant Project Director in writing with a reason for the delay and the proposed revised schedule. The request for a revised schedule must include the impact on related tasks and the overall project;
A request for a revised schedule must be reviewed and approved by the HHSC Grant Project Director before placed in effect; and
HHSC will complete a review of each submitted deliverable or request for amended deliverable schedule within ten (10) business days of receipt, unless both Parties agree to an extended response time.

A little about us:




The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.




Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.




Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.




A Day In The Life




You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door.




Requirements




What you bring to the table:




Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.




All Of Our Data Scientists Need The Following Skills




Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.

Why DISCO?




We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:




We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO’s long-term strategy.
We believe that product and engineering professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we’re going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don’t commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view. At DISCO respect isn’t earned, it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you’ll find yourself learning at a rate you’ve not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you’ll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best “career shape” of your life.
Over the next 4 years, we’ll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way
We use the “2 Pizza Team” organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we’re an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you’re passionate about your craft.




Perks of DISCO




Open, inclusive, and fun environment
Benefits, including medical
Competitive salary
Flexible PTO
Opportunity to be a part of a company that is revolutionizing the legal industry
Growth opportunities throughout the company




About DISCO




DISCO provides a cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal solution that simplifies ediscovery, legal document review and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers and governments. Our scalable, integrated solution enables legal departments to easily collect, process and review enterprise data that is relevant or potentially relevant to legal matters.




Are you ready to help us fulfill our mission to use technology to strengthen the rule of law? Join us!




We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.




Please note that DISCO has a mandatory COVID vaccination policy which requires all employees in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated, subject to applicable legal exemptions.

The Research and Innovation team at Global Fishing Watch connects data science and machine learning experts with leaders in the scientific community to produce new datasets, publish impactful research, and empower others to use our data.

We aim to reveal the activity of all ocean-going vessels in the world. Because most vessels do not broadcast their locations using the automatic identification system (AIS), we need to draw on satellite imagery to see all vessels. Additionally, the ocean is experiencing an accelerated expansion of offshore infrastructure. Thus, to quantify the true global footprint of fishing and non-fishing vessel activity, as well as the evolution of fixed infrastructure at sea, Global Fishing Watch is applying deep learning and data fusion techniques to petabytes of satellite imagery (radar and optical), and AIS.

The data scientist will play a key role supporting the Research and Innovation team's work to integrate multiple data sources into the most complete picture of human activity at sea. The position's major activities will include data fusion using statistical methods to combine the outputs of our object detection models and AIS. Other activities include, but are not limited to, improving the labelling of data for training object detection models, and developing algorithms for geospatial analysis to advance Global Fishing Watch datasets, as well as maintaining code repositories, and assisting the development of research projects.

The successful candidate will have an interest in environmental issues and a versatile skill set in geospatial analysis, statistics and programming. The incumbent will build diverse technical skills in programming, big data, and cloud computing and gain a variety of experience working for a globally diverse, fully distributed, and growing organization.

Principal Duties And Responsibilities

Geospatial data fusion and analysis

Improve upon methods in Kroodsma et. al (2022), including 1) matching radar/optical vessel detections to AIS and 2) estimating total vessel presence using the improved methods
Integrate detections from multiple sources (e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical), accounting for the recall of each model, length of the objects, cloudiness, and image resolution, among others
Improve training datasets for vessel and fixed infrastructure detection models and build new training datasets for other human-made objects, potentially managing contractors to generate labels.


Additional tasks may include

Provide technical support to the senior data scientist(s) responsible for developing and advancing other Global Fishing Watch datasets
Analyze large amounts of data from various sources, such as vessel activity, identity, and satellite imagery to identify trends, anomalies, and insights
Maintain and improve automated processes to extract and compile data from publicly available sources, such as vessel registries
Ensure the integrity and accuracy of key data pipelines and research tables
Maintain and improve internal Python tools, such as modules and template repositories, to assist with migrating research projects from proof-of-concepts to automated prototypes


Candidate Description

Qualifications you should have

Graduate degree and at least two years of professional experience, or an equivalent combination of education and experience
Experience developing analysis methods with Python
Strong foundation in mathematics and statistics
Experience in geospatial analysis of satellite imagery and remotely sensed data
Ability to work with large datasets and visualize data effectively
Experience with version control software and collaboration tools such as git and GitHub
Highly organized, analytical, detail oriented and self-motivated
Ability to work efficiently and with an eye for detail
Willingness to take ownership of projects and effectively communicate updates in a transparent and proactive manner
Ability to manage multiple priorities while performing in a fast-paced, collaborative environment


Also great

Some experience with additional programming languages such as SQL and R
Familiarity with containerization tools like Docker
Experience engaging with academic researchers and the peer-review process
An understanding of the complexities and collaboration required to work effectively for a globally remote organization


If you don't think you check all the boxes, but believe you have unique skills that make you a great fit for the role, we want to hear from you!
