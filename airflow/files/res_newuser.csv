developed linear, lasso, ridge and bagged linear regression models to predict flight delays for 3rd and 4th quarters of . presented  flight delay data visually through dashboards using leaflet in r
implemented neural network regression and classification approaches using an architecture inspired by u-net in keras to convert grayscale images to colorized rgb images with an accuracy of 70
enriched existing text summarization model with pre-trained bertsum encoder model and decoder architecture written in pytorch by introducing recurrence in model to improve copying of source text, achieved a rogue score of 19.03
project name 5  data science challenge
derived insights from a list of 19,439 restaurants and businesses with menu items containing tacos and burritos from across the us. generated stories and delivered an interactive visualization tool using tableau to showcase data analysis
